# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project README

This are the Instructions for the  Course Project
## Introduction

The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
This project contains the work I have done for the course project.

## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Projectless 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
I have submited: 
1. a tidy data set and code to get this tidy data
2. a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, and
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations.

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Results
The description of the process and transformation of the data is explained in detail in the R script **run_Analysis.R** . 
The codebook explain the variable names and units. Most of the names is self sufficient but the introduction make the understanding of then easier.
